# php-chat-trial
Just create a database with the name chat2 and import the uploaded sql file . 

Things to fix :

1) Looks ugly.
2) Using session , eliminate the filling part for the sender name .
3) Using JS onclick menthod , identify the other country clicked and fill the receiver name dynamically.
4) Main aim is to make the sender and the receiver text boxes hidden and fill them up dynamically by using the points 2 and 3 .
